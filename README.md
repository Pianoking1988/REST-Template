# REST Webservice Template

## Description

Template for any REST based webservice, including:
* REST versionizing via /v1/..., /v2/...

## Technologies

* _Spring-Boot_ / _Spring_
* _Swagger_ for documentation of the rest service

## Problems / Issues

* Swagger does not recognize within request documention that V1 uses v1 user and not v2 user.
  Response documentation is fine.

## Still missing / In the future

* Lombok for automatic generation of getters, setters and boilerplate class methods
